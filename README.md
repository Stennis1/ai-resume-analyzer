# AI Resume Analyzer

An AI-powered, full-stack web application that analyzes a resume against a job description and returns a match score, missing skills, and actionable improvement suggestions using a Large Language Model (LLM).

This project focuses on **practical AI integration and real-world system design**, rather than academic machine learning or model training.

## 🧠 What This Application Does

Given:

* A resume (plain text)
* A job description

The system returns:

* A **match score (0–100)**
* A list of **missing or weak skills**
* **Actionable improvement suggestions**
* A concise **final verdict** from a recruiter’s perspective

This mirrors how modern AI-powered tools are used in hiring platforms, HR tech, and internal developer tooling.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

```
Frontend (Next.js)
        |
        |  HTTP (JSON)
        v
Backend API (FastAPI)
        |
        |  Prompt + Context
        v
Large Language Model (LLM)
```

* The frontend handles user input and result presentation
* The backend validates requests and orchestrates AI inference
* The AI model performs structured analysis using prompt engineering

The frontend and backend are developed in a single repository and deployed independently.

## 🔍 Key Engineering Decisions

### Why FastAPI?

* Strong request validation with Pydantic
* Automatic interactive API documentation (`/docs`)
* Excellent fit for AI-driven and data-oriented services
* Minimal boilerplate with production-grade structure

### Why Use LLM APIs Instead of Training a Model?

* Reflects how AI is used in real-world products
* Faster iteration and significantly lower operational cost
* Focuses on **AI system design**, not model research

### Why Enforce Structured JSON Output?

* Predictable frontend rendering
* Easier validation and error handling
* Prevents malformed or ambiguous AI responses
* Safer than free-form text generation

## 📦 API Example

### Endpoint

`POST /analyze-resume`

### Request

```json
{
  "resume": "Experienced backend engineer with Python and APIs...",
  "job_description": "Looking for a Python developer with cloud experience..."
}
```

### Response

```json
{
  "match_score": 78,
  "missing_skills": ["Docker", "AWS"],
  "suggestions": [
    "Add quantified achievements",
    "Highlight cloud-related projects"
  ],
  "verdict": "Strong candidate with minor gaps"
}
```

## 🔐 Environment Variables

The backend requires environment variables for secure configuration.

Example:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Environment files are excluded from version control.

---

## 🧪 Running Locally

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

## 📈 Future Enhancements (Non-Breaking)

The current architecture supports future extensions such as:

* PDF resume upload
* Resume history and comparisons
* Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
* Authentication
* Analytics and feedback tracking

These additions can be introduced **without rewriting the core system**.
